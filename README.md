A collection of agent skills for pharmaceutical R&D.

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [group-sequential-design](group-sequential-design/) | Design group sequential clinical trials for survival endpoints (OS, PFS, DFS) with interim analyses, spending functions, multiplicity, and event/enrollment prediction |

## Usage

**Option 1: Conversational / CLI**
Ask your agent to directly enable a skill from this repo:
> enable "group-sequential-design" skill from https://github.com/RConsortium/pharma_skills

**Option 2: Local IDE (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, etc.)**
1. Clone this repository locally or as a git submodule.
2. Symlink the skill you want into your project, or manually reference it in your configuration files (like `.cursorrules` or `llms.txt`):
   `Please refer to /path/to/pharma_skills/group-sequential-design/SKILL.md for the trial design workflow.`

## Contributing
